Future Work:
While this project successfully developed a machine learning-based sentiment analysis system for YouTube comment classification, several improvements can be explored to enhance accuracy, scalability, and real-world applicability.
1. Integration of Deep Learning Models
- Implement transformer-based models like BERT, RoBERTa, or LSTMs to better capture the context and nuances of spam vs. non-spam comments.
- Utilize pre-trained word embeddings to improve feature representation and classification accuracy.

2. Real-Time Sentiment Analysis
- Deploy the model as a real-time spam detection system using streaming data pipelines.
- Implement incremental learning to adapt to new comment patterns dynamically.

3. Enhanced Spam Detection Mechanisms
- Incorporate rule-based filtering alongside machine learning to handle ambiguous and sophisticated spam messages.
- Utilize ensemble learning techniques by combining Decision Trees, Random Forest, and deep learning architectures for improved classification.

4. Multilingual Sentiment Classification
- Extend the dataset to support multiple languages, ensuring broader applicability in international YouTube communities.
- Use pre-trained multilingual embeddings to enhance sentiment analysis across different language structures.

5. Explainability & Model Interpretability
- Implement SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) or LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to explain the decision-making process of models.
- Improve user trust and adoption by providing transparency on why a comment is classified as spam or non-spam.
